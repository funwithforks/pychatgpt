# pychatgpt
My own commandline chatgpt interface  
Get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  
Paste it into a file called 'secret' or paste it into line 10 of chat.py  
run 'python3 chat.py'  
Chat with the AI...  
Enter 'quit' to exit or 'new' to start a new chat.  
Chats are saved to a file. I will separate them later to continue previous convos.
